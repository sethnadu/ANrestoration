                <h2><i>About:</i> Basement</h2>
                <p>This is a basement remodel we just completed-- the rooms were previously used as a gun room and a sewing room and we did a total transformation, turning them into a luxury master suite and master bath. We demolished and expanded all of the existing walls to create a large bedroom and bathroom. For the master bedroom we did all new electrical, created a closet with a sliding reclaimed barn door. For the luxury master bathroom we did all new plumbing and electrical. We used cherry trim and old barn boards and finished the trim with a torch to give it a weathered look. A custom shower was also installed as well as custom- made towel and toilet paper holder. This was one of our favorite restoration peojects--we are your start to finish restoration company!</p>

            <h2><i>About:</i> Remodel</h2>
            <p>This house is one of a few we have been working on in Mount Gretna . The first floor of his house had multiple levels in the existing flooring. The carpet and tile entryway were removed and the entire floor was raised up over 1" using layers of plywood. This brought everything to the same level height as the kitchen floor. New laminate flooring was installed throughout the entire area and new quarter round was installed. All the cabinet doors were trimmed to fit the new floor. The stairs were stripped of their carpet and cleaned and so was the hallway upstairs to reveal the original wood floors. All the Staples were removed throughout all the floors. The bathroom floor was also removed and new laminate was installed as well as a toilet and trim.</p>

                <h2><i>About:</i> Hallway</h2>
                <p>This was our big summer project we were working on over the last few months. A whole gut of an upstairs of an1800s farmhouse. Electrical was all redone, ceiling fans were installed and electrical outlets were recessed into the baseboard. The walls were stripped of wallpaper, cracks were all repaired and replastered then painted. All the floors were stripped, repaired, sanded and redone. We also took out a wall between two bedrooms to create a hallway, linen closet, a common area, and a nursery. All the original trim was painstakingly removed, due to the fact that it cannot be reproduced, and was all reused for the new doors and trim work. This allowed us to seamlessly blend old and new construction.</p>

                <p>This is the rest of the kitchen that included the built-in we were restoring earlier. The upper and lower cabinets were removed. The wall was in terrible shape so everything was strengthened and new drywall was installed. New electrical was ran for recepticles and for the range hood. We then built the lower cabinets, shelves and lower open shelve which matches the built in. The shelves are old salvaged wood that we cleaned and stained. We built a desk next to the refrigerator that will accommodate a trash can underneath. We then cut, polished, installed and sealed the granite countertops. The plumbing was also redone. We moved the pendant lights around in the ceiling to better serve the working areas and also fixed the damaged plaster and matched the textured look of the ceiling. We also stripped off all the plaster on the exterior wall and repointed and sealed the wall. We made the backsplash to match the cabinets and the profiles on the built in aswell. We also replaced a broken step on the stairs and many other small projects throughout the house. Eventually the floors will be getting replaced and the rest of the walls and trim will be repainted.</p>

                <p>A before and after of a renovated family room/playroom in our own renovation project! This room was one of the 2 kitchens in our home, and the location directly off of our new kitchen seemed like the perfect place to put our family room. We had to completely gut what was there but once done we had such a great space to work with! We chose to do a shiplap throughout with varying sized boards, built a large closet for the kids toys/crafts, and made a beautiful wooden radiator cover. Lots of natural light and neutral colors with all the wood makes this room warm and inviting!</p>

                <p>This double sided fireplace was in two rooms. The homeowners tore out the wall and wanted to expose the fireplace. Since the brick was different on both sides, one side was torn down and relayed to match the other side as well as provisions for a tv and mantels added. New flagstone was layed to match the existing side. Then we whitewashed the whole thing.</p>

                <p>As promised, here are some before and after pictures of the master bathroom. Just needs a final cleaning and it will be completed. Tub was rusted and damaged. Sink was in worse condition than the tub. Rot and mold was abundant. The floor was rotted out and sagging. Knob and tube wiring through out the bathroom. Rest of the house was already rewired. Tub was completely stripped and sanded. About 10 layers of paint on feet!  Radiator was stripped and repainted aswell. Entire floor was removed, jacked up and leveled. Then the joists were repaired and reinforced. Most of the plumbing and electrical was replaced aswell.  New everything. Complete new subfloor, hardiboard and tile. New custom shower head and mounts. Plastic S trap drain was replaced with the new chrome P trap and vent. Sink was cleaned, repaired and rebuilt. New lights and mirror. Custom hand made shower curtain rod and new exhaust fan. Walls and ceiling were repaired and given a skimcoat of plaster. The built in was originally a window years past. </p>
